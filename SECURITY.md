The [Rust Security Response WG][team] handles vulnerability reports and
security issues for all the repositories in the **rust-lang** and
**rust-lang-nursery** organizations. If you found a vulnerability please report
it [according to the security policy on our website][policy]. 

For security issues with crates written in Rust, see [the crates.io security 
page][crates].

Thanks!
